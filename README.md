## What is Prodigy?
Prodigy is a **drag-and-drop page builder and CMS** for Laravel. 

Visual page builders have exploded in popularity ‚Äì with companies like Webflow, Squarespace, Elementor, and Beaver Builder. But Laravel hasn't had it's own page builder that felt like it ‚Äúfit‚Äù within the system.

### Prodigy brings the best ideas from visual page-building to Laravel. 
- Drag and drop [blade components](https://prodigyphp.com/docs/making-blocks) ü§Ø
- Editable content
- Global blocks (headers and footers)
- Portable...one folder with all your content.
- Unbelievably fast


You can let Prodigy handle the marketing portion of your Laravel app or use it standalone for a marketing site. From the start, you get all the power and speed of Laravel ‚Äì Eloquent, Livewire, Blade components, Octane, queues ‚Äì with the simplicity of a visual page builder. 

Plus, it's free.

### Key features
